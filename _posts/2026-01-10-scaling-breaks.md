Scaling doesn’t usually break *technology* first. It breaks **assumptions**.

A few patterns I’ve seen repeat:

- **Ownership drifts** before systems fail.
- **Interfaces become ambiguous** before performance becomes a problem.
- **Decision-making slows** before delivery slows.

The fix is rarely “more process.” It’s usually clarity: what matters, who owns it, and how decisions get made.

More to come.
