## What I do

I work at the intersection of **technology, leadership, and product**.

Over the years, I’ve helped teams grow from early-stage chaos to sustainable scale—by focusing on clarity, systems, and people rather than hype or shortcuts.

This site is a place for thoughtful writing, practical guides, and lessons learned from building software—and a life—designed for the long term.
