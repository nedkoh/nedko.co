## The goal

Scaling a team isn’t about hiring faster. It’s about increasing **throughput and quality** without increasing chaos.

## The core constraints

- Context doesn’t scale.
- Ownership doesn’t scale by default.
- Communication costs compound.

## A simple model that works

1. **Define what “good” means** (quality, reliability, delivery, customer impact)
2. **Create clear ownership** (systems, domains, outcomes)
3. **Reduce decision latency** (principles, guardrails, lightweight rituals)
4. **Build leadership density** (coaching, delegation, trust)
5. **Protect sustainability** (on-call health, focus time, reasonable pace)

If you’d like, I can expand this guide into a full playbook with templates.
