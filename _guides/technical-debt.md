Technical debt isn’t “bad engineering.” It’s often the price of learning.

The leadership job is to manage debt like a portfolio:

- What debt increases optionality?
- What debt increases fragility?
- What debt blocks delivery?
- What debt silently taxes every change?

The right question is rarely “should we pay it down?”
It’s: **what is the cost of carrying it, and who feels it?**
