title: About
---

I’m Nedko Hristov technology leader and entrepreneur with experience building and scaling SaaS products.

My work sits at the intersection of **engineering, product, and leadership**, where I focus on creating systems and teams that scale without losing clarity, quality, or humanity.

I value long-term thinking, simple solutions to complex problems, and leadership that prioritizes responsibility over status.

Outside of work, I’m a husband and a father—roles that strongly influence how I think about time, sustainability, and impact.

This site is a collection of what I’ve learned so far, and what I’m still exploring, as I build technology—and a life—designed to last.
